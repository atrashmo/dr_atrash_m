Dr Atrash Mohsin is a multilingual engineer and scientist, currently serves as the structural engineer of the design office at Kick Sauber F1 Team (Sauber Motorsport). In this role, he has been responsible for the successful release of several key components, including fire safety systems, aerodynamic updates (e.g., rear wings), structural brackets, and dynamic models. He has also developed and implemented cohesive modeling methodologies, led conversions of models into simulation software, conducted thermal testing, and worked on advanced 3D nonlinear modeling for complex materials.

Prior to his current role, he served as a Principal Scientist / Lead Development Engineer at Innosuisse / Empa, developing novel composite structures (design, manufacture, testing and modelling) for civil and structural applications in Switzerland.

Before relocating to Switzerland, he was a Senior Research Scientist at Schlumberger (Cambridge, UK) where he worked on developing nonlinear numerical models for novel cutting structures for rock formationsâ€”designing and optimising next generation drilling tools for oil and gas applications.

Since March 2020, he has been appointed as a Visiting Researcher at the Department of Aeronautics of Imperial College, within the Faculty of Engineering to contribute towards the departmental research activity in materials science and engineering.

Atrash is a highly motivated and competent multilingual engineer with over eight years of experience in developing innovative solutions in mechanical, materials, design and manufacturing engineering in collaboration with automotive, aerospace, civil and structural as well as oil and gas services organisations.

He started his undergraduate studies in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at the University of Melbourne, but later completed it with First Class Honours at the University of Nottingham. Following his graduation, Atrash pursued Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at University College London (UCL), specialising in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of F1 cars. Atrash obtained his PhD and DIC in Aeronautical Engineering from Imperial College London in 2019, where he focused on the manufacturing, testing, modelling and failure analysis of composites for the automotive and aerospace industry.
